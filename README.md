# Welcome to Approval Flow Task! ü§ñ

In this task we will build the the ‚ù§Ô∏è functionality of [Approve.com](https://approve.com) - Approval Flow.

## 01 Background
The approval flow is the main part of our product that is used in purchase, vendor, contract, etc.

The approval flow consist of two parts:
 - Organizational Tree
 - Functional chain

**The approval flow is a path in organization tree + all nodes of functional chain.**

### Organizational Tree
Organization part of the approval flow is basically is hierarchy of the organization in json representation. Similar to this one:
```json
{
  "name": "A",
  "userId": "2",
  "title": "CEO",
  "email": "a@approve.com",
  "reportsToId": "",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "B",
      "userId": "9",
      "title": "CTO",
      "email": "b@approve.com",
      "reportsToId": "2",
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "C",
          "userId": "19",
          "title": "VP R&D",
          "email": "c@approve.com",
          "reportsToId": "9",
          "children": [
            {
              "name": "D",
              "userId": "33",
              "title": "Full Stack Developer",
              "email": "d@approve.com",
              "reportsToId": "19"
            },
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "E",
          "userId": "27",
          "title": "VP Product",
          "email": "e@approve.com",
          "reportsToId": "2",
          "children": [
            {
              "name": "F",
              "userId": "21",
              "title": "Product Designer",
              "email": "f@approve.com",
              "reportsToId": "27"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

### Functional chain
After the organizational part of the approval is over, there are usually some functional steps. For example, after approving the purchase of a monitor, procurement people should create an order.

In terms of a data structure, functional part of the flow is just a list of nodes.
